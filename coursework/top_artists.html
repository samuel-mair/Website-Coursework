          <h4> Sam's favourite and most streamed artist JID </h4>
          <p> Ever since JID's release of his third studio album 'The Forever Story', he has been at the top of Sam's rotation. The release of this album prompted Sam to explore the rest of his discography and the rest is history. Since the creation of Sam's Spotify account in May 2023, he has listened to JID for a total of 22,380 minutes, with 13,186 of those being spent listening to 'The Forever Story'.

      <div class="col-md-4 artist-info">
        <h4> Sam's second highest streamed artist Travis Scott </h4>
        <p> Travis Scott's music is some of the most catchy and replayable music that Sam has ever listened to in his life. The production of almost every song is masterful and makes you want to listen again, not to mention Travis Scott's unforgettable voice. He sits comfortably as Sam' second highest streamed artist with 20070 minutes. 11,455 of those being spent listening to his long awaited fourth studio album 'Utopia'. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 artist-info">
        <h4> Sam's third highest streamed artist Kendrick Lamar</h4>
        <p>Kendrick Lamar is arguably the greatest hip-hop artist of all time. His profound lyrical depth and innovation shown in his album 'DAMN.' won him the prestigious Pulitzer Prize award, an award that had never been given to any music genre other than jazz and classical, thus cementing Lamar as a pioneer in the hip-hop industry. Sam has listened to Kendrick Lamar's music for 14,436 minutes, with an almost even spread among his most recent four albums, 3,946 on his most recent album 'Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers', 3859 minutes on 'good kid, m.A.A.d city', 2875 minutes on 'DAMN.', and 1705 minutes on the legendary 'To Pimp a Butterfly'. </p>
